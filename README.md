# fcc-salon-scheduler
This is just the repository needed for completing the fcc project. It contains the database file with the base data for the services as well as the script file to "book/create" appointments.

More information about the actual project can be found on [freeCodeCamp's website](https://www.freecodecamp.org) under the Relational Database section of the Cirriculum.
